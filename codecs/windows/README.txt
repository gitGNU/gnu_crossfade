This directory contains the installers for the Xiph codecs on
Windows. These codecs will enable Windows Media Playe, iTunes, and
other music player programs to play the FLAC audio format (as well as
Ogg Vorbis, Theora, WebM, and other media formats). FLAC is a lossless
audio codec that compresses audio files to take up less space without
sacrificing any sound quality, making it ideal for DJing. It is not
necessary to keep these codec installers to use Crossfade GNU/Linux,
although keeping them can be useful for exchanging music in FLAC with
Windows users.

opencodecs_0.85.17777.exe installs the Xiph codecs for DirectShow,
which is used by Windows Media Players and other music player programs.
xiph-qt-win32-0.1.5.exe installs the Xiph codecs for QuickTime, which
is used by iTunes.
