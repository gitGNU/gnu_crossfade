This directory contains the installer for the Xiph codecs on Mac OS
X. These codecs will enable iTunes to play the FLAC audio format (as
well as Ogg Vorbis, Theora, WebM, and other media formats). FLAC is a
lossless audio codec that compresses audio files to take up less space
without sacrificing any sound quality, making it ideal for DJing. It is
not necessary to keep these codec installers to use Crossfade GNU/Linux,
although keeping them can be useful for exchanging music in FLAC with
OS X users.
